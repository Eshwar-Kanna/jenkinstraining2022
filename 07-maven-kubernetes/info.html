------------- Integrating Jenkins And Kubernetes  --------------

=> KOPS  is the tool used to install Kubernetes in AWS

=> we use kubernetes in the final stage ie. prod env since we manage resources to clients from the prod stage which is directly connected 

	 		         slave 1 
	prod env    -     master 		
			          slave 2


KOPS  will setup the complete k8s cluster

connect to prod env  instance
	run commands 

## DOWNLOAD KOPS 

curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64

ls

##  TO MAKE FILE EXECUTABLE

chmod +x kops-linux-amd64

##  MOVE FILE TO kops 

sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

## downloading kubectl command

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

## kubectl executable

chmod +x ./kubectl

## moving file to  kubectl 

sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/bin/kubectl



	create a IAM role in AWS to integrate Ec2 and S3
IAM - roles - create role (ec2s3) - ec2 - Administrator Access - create

## provide this role to the prod env 
      prod os - actions - security - Modify IAM role - select ec2s3 and save

## creating a s3 storage with name kanna in ap-south-1

aws s3 mb s3://kanna.in.k8s --region ap-south-1

#storing S3 in a variable KOPS_STATE_STORE

export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://kanna.in.k8s

## create a Route53 
	aws - Route53 - Hosted zones - create Hosted zone - jenkins123.com - private , ap-south-1 , vpc  and  create 

##   storing Route53 in a variable KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME

export KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=jenkinstraining.com

## to make this variables permanent we add commands in file
# vim /root/.bashrc 
export KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=jenkinstraining.com
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://kanna.in.k8s

## to generate pubkey and privatekey 
ssh-keygen


## to create the cluster 

kops create cluster \
--state=${KOPS_STATE_STORE} \
--node-count=2 \
--master-size=t3.medium \
--node-size=t3.medium \
--zones=ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b \
--name=${KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME} \
--dns private \
--master-count 1

##
kops get cluster 

## to configure the cluster 
kops update cluster --name jenkinstraining.com --yes --admin

# 

kops validate cluster --wait 10m



######  we developed a myjavaapp in previous pipeline at port 8080
but to auto scale and auto recreate after destruction we use kubernetes

we use webappsvc.yml   to expose the app to particular port all the time

code in webappsvc.yml

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Service
	metadata:
	  name: my-service
	  labels:
	    app:  myapp-service
	spec:
	  selector:
	    app: myjavawebapp
	  type: NodePort
	  ports:
	    - nodePort: 30000
	      port: 8080
	      targetPort: 8080


####  instead using the triggers that auto build when code changes and push to the repo , in which the jenkins should trigger the code every instant to check wheather the code is changed we can use webhooks of the repo such that the github send the code to jenkins when the code changed

	create webhook - go to repo : settings : webhook :
payload repo ( http://<ip of jenkins >:8080/github-webhook/) : select just push event and can select as per requirement

to automate the push after commiting the code in git we use hooks

	in git 
	
	cd /.git/hooks/
		vim post-commit
			#!/bin/sh
			git push

as soon as we commit the file will be pushed automatically


## to run build using API   ###  ie. when we hit a url the build starts

in the configuration of Pipeline   - select Trigger build remotely and provide a password  as token 
	use url as 
		jenkinsip:8080/job/<jobname>/build?token=<password used>


but to run through API from other os it requires the authentication of jenkins which is not better practise to provide to all in such case we use a access token of jenkins 

	In jenkins - account - configure- API Token  - generate token 
 and use  
	curl  -u username:token   api


to manage jenkins using CLI 

	mange jenkins - jenkins Cli - here the java command is provided use it in the CMD prompt  add auth  and use rewuire option such as  get-job   for getting info


ROLE BASED ACTION CONTROL
download plugin - Role based autherization strategy 

Dashboard - Manage users - create user
	

	bydefault every user get administrator access but to give certain role of access 


Manage jenkins - config Global security ( authorization role based strategy ) and save

manage & assign role - manage roles - and give required access 

provide this role to any user to get this particular access

we can use regex like DEV_*   so that all the user starting username with DEV   can be accessed to the role
