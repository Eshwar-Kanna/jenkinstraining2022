
we use Maven  of JAVA  here that  has the capability of that it can download the libraries or dependencies that the code needed as per developer 
	pom.xml  is the file that have libraries

whenever the code is given to maven it check cthe code and pom.xml  and perform actions accordingly such as install , compile , and  test 

	connect to slave instance 
		sudo yum install git  -y
		git clone  https://github.com/Eshwar-Kanna/simple-java-maven-jenkins2022.git
		sudo yum install java -y
		sudo yum install maven  -y


	go to the folder cloned from the url 
		mvn compile
			a target folder is created after compiled

		mvn package  
			 my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file is created in target folder

	to access the code run 
		java  -jar    my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
			the output of code will be displayed here


		mvn package clean 
			to clean the package   and re compile and re create the package when 			code updated 




	To use maven in jenkins for testing the code 
In jenkins  : manage jenkins  :  manage plugins  : search maven integration and install

In Jenkins  
	create new item - freestyle - Github project ( https://github.com/Eshwar-Kanna/simple-java-maven-jenkins2022.git)  - Restrict where this project can be run(linuxbuildnode) - SCM (git)(repo url : https://github.com/Eshwar-Kanna/simple-java-maven-jenkins2022.git )(credentials : ec2-user) - Build steps (invoke top -level Maven targets  : Goals : clean package)  - add build step : Execute shell : java -jar target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar   - Add post build actions : Archieve the artifacts : target/*.jar  and SAVE
